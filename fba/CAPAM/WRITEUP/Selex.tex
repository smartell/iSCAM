	% The following abstract is the place holder submitted for the selectivity workshop in La Jolla, CA

    Changes in the observed size- or age-composition of commercial catch can occur for a variety of reasons including: market demand, availability, temporal changes in growth, time-area closures, regulations, or change in fishing practice, to name but a few.  Two common approaches for dealing with time-varying selectivity in assessment models are the use of discrete time-blocks associated with an epoch in the history of the fishery, or the use of penalized random walk models for parametric or non-parametric selectivity curves.  Time block periods, or penalty weights associated with time-varying selectivity parameters, are subjective and often developed on an ad hoc basis. A factorial simulation-estimation experiment, with discrete or continuous changes in selectivity, is conducted to determine the best practices for modeling time-varying selectivity in fisheries stock assessments. Both the statistical properties of the assessment model and the policy implications of choosing the wrong model are taken into consideration.
